Automate emails that send recipients a Yucatecan Mayan word to learn 

## Helpful Resources
- Credit to this [Towards Data Science article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-automate-emails-with-python-8b476045c151)
by Frank Andrade for the code used to configure the EmailMessage class and for the instructions on setting up an 
email account to be used for this automation.
- The CSV of Yucatecan Mayan words was gathered from an [introductory Spanish to Maya dictionary](https://www.uqroo.mx/libros/maya/diccionario.pdf) 
from the University of Quintano Roo. A separate project of mine involved parsing this PDF into the CSV within this 
repo using PDFMiner and a mix of regular expression. However, since many of the pages and sometimes words were 
unstandardized, not all word-definition pairs could be cleanly parsed. Typos, therefore, exist within some rows
in this CSV.
